Description: A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of
    the DBSCAN family for spatial data. Includes the clustering algorithms 
    DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise)
    and HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN), the ordering algorithm
    OPTICS (ordering points to identify the clustering structure), 
    and the outlier detection algorithm LOF (local outlier factor). 
    The implementations use the kd-tree data structure (from library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. 
    An R interface to fast kNN and fixed-radius NN search is also provided.
