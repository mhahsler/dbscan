Description: A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms
    of the DBSCAN family. Includes the clustering algorithms DBSCAN
    (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) and
    HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN), the ordering algorithm OPTICS (ordering
    points to identify the clustering structure), shared nearest neighbor
    clustering, and the outlier detection algorithms LOF (local outlier
    factor) and GLOSH (global-local outlier score from hierarchies). The
    implementations use the kd-tree data structure (from library ANN) for
    faster k-nearest neighbor search. An R interface to fast kNN and
    fixed-radius NN search is also provided.  Hahsler, Piekenbrock and
