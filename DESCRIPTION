Description: A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of the DBSCAN family for spatial data. Includes the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) and OPTICS (ordering points to identify the clustering structure) clustering algorithms and the LOF (local outlier factor) algorithm. The implementations uses the kd-tree data structure (from library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. An R interface to fast kNN and fixed-radius NN search is also provided.
