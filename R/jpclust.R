#' Jarvis-Patrick Clustering
#'
#' Fast C++ implementation of the Jarvis-Patrick clustering which first builds
#' a shared nearest neighbor graph (k nearest neighbor sparsification) and then
#' places two points in the same cluster if they are in each other's nearest
#' neighbor list and they share at least kt nearest neighbors.
#'
#' Following the original paper, the shared nearest neighbor list is
#' constructed as the k neighbors plus the point itself (as neighbor zero).
#' Therefore, the threshold `kt` needs to be in the range \eqn{[1, k]}.
#'
#' Fast nearest neighbors search with [kNN()] is only used if `x` is
#' a matrix. In this case Euclidean distance is used.
#'
#' @aliases jpclust print.general_clustering
#' @family clustering functions
#'
#' @param x a data matrix/data.frame (Euclidean distance is used), a
#' precomputed [dist] object or a kNN object created with [kNN()].
#' @param k Neighborhood size for nearest neighbor sparsification. If `x`
#' is a kNN object then `k` may be missing.
#' @param kt threshold on the number of shared nearest neighbors (including the
#' points themselves) to form clusters. Range: \eqn{[1, k]}
#' @param ...  additional arguments are passed on to the k nearest neighbor
#' search algorithm. See [kNN()] for details on how to control the
#' search strategy.
#'
#' @return A object of class `general_clustering` with the following
#' components:
#' \item{cluster }{A integer vector with cluster assignments. Zero
#' indicates noise points.}
#' \item{type }{ name of used clustering algorithm.}
#' \item{param }{ list of used clustering parameters. }
