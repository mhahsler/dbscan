#' Calculate and Plot k-Nearest Neighbor Distances
#'
#' Fast calculation of the k-nearest neighbor distances for a dataset
#' represented as a matrix of points. The kNN distance is defined as the
#' distance from a point to its k nearest neighbor. The kNN distance plot
#' displays the kNN distance of all points sorted from smallest to largest. The
#' plot can be used to help find suitable parameter values for [dbscan()].
#'
#' @family Outlier Detection Functions
#' @family NN functions
#'
#' @param x the data set as a matrix of points (Euclidean distance is used) or
#' a precalculated [dist] object.
#' @param k number of nearest neighbors used for the distance calculation. For
#' `kNNdistplot()` also a range of values for `k` or `minPts` can be specified.
#' @param minPts to use a k-NN plot to determine a suitable `eps` value for [dbscan()],
#'    `minPts` used in dbscan can be specified and will set `k = minPts - 1`.
#' @param all should a matrix with the distances to all k nearest neighbors be
#' returned?
#' @param ... further arguments (e.g., kd-tree related parameters) are passed
#' on to [kNN()].
#'
#' @return `kNNdist()` returns a numeric vector with the distance to its k
#' nearest neighbor. If `all = TRUE` then a matrix with k columns
#' containing the distances to all 1st, 2nd, ..., kth nearest neighbors is
#' returned instead.
