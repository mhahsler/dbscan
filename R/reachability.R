#' Reachability Distances
#'
#' Reachability distances can be plotted to show the hierarchical relationships between data points.
#' The idea was originally introduced by Ankerst et al (1999) for [OPTICS]. Later,
#' Sanders et al (2003) showed that the visualization is useful for other hierarchical
#' structures and introduced an algorithm to convert [dendrogram] representation to
#' reachability plots.
#'
#' A reachability plot displays the points as vertical bars, were the height is the
#' reachability distance between two consecutive points.
#' The central idea behind reachability plots is that the ordering in which
#' points are plotted identifies underlying hierarchical density
#' representation as mountains and valleys of high and low reachability distance.
#' The original ordering algorithm OPTICS as described by Ankerst et al (1999)
#' introduced the notion of reachability plots.
#'
#' OPTICS linearly orders the data points such that points
#' which are spatially closest become neighbors in the ordering. Valleys
#' represent clusters, which can be represented hierarchically. Although the
#' ordering is crucial to the structure of the reachability plot, its important
#' to note that OPTICS, like DBSCAN, is not entirely deterministic and, just
#' like the dendrogram, isomorphisms may exist
#'
#' Reachability plots were shown to essentially convey the same information as
#' the more traditional dendrogram structure by Sanders et al (2003). An dendrograms
#' can be converted into reachability plots.
#'
#' Different hierarchical representations, such as dendrograms or reachability
#' plots, may be preferable depending on the context. In smaller datasets,
#' cluster memberships may be more easily identifiable through a dendrogram
#' representation, particularly is the user is already familiar with tree-like
#' representations. For larger datasets however, a reachability plot may be
#' preferred for visualizing macro-level density relationships.
#'
#' A variety of cluster extraction methods have been proposed using
#' reachability plots. Because both cluster extraction depend directly on the
#' ordering OPTICS produces, they are part of the [optics()] interface.
#' Nonetheless, reachability plots can be created directly from other types of
#' linkage trees, and vice versa.
#'
#' _Note:_ The reachability distance for the first point is by definition not defined
#' (it has no preceeding point).
#' Also, the reachability distances can be undefined when a point does not have enough
#' neighbors in the epsilon neighborhood. We represent these undefined cases as `Inf`
#' and represent them in the plot as a dashed line.
