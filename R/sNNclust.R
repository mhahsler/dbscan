#' Shared Nearest Neighbor Clustering
#'
#' Implements the shared nearest neighbor clustering algorithm by Ertoz,
#' Steinbach and Kumar (2003).
#'
#' **Algorithm:**
#'
#' 1. Constructs a shared nearest neighbor graph for a given k. The edge
#' weights are the number of shared k nearest neighbors (in the range of
#' \eqn{[0, k]}).
#'
#' 2. Find each points SNN density, i.e., the number of points which have a
#' similarity of `eps` or greater.
#'
#' 3. Find the core points, i.e., all points that have an SNN density greater
#' than `MinPts`.
#'
#' 4. Form clusters from the core points and assign border points (i.e.,
#' non-core points which share at least `eps` neighbors with a core point).
#'
#' Note that steps 2-4 are equivalent to the DBSCAN algorithm (see [dbscan()])
#' and that `eps` has a different meaning than for DBSCAN. Here it is
#' a threshold on the number of shared neighbors (see [sNN()])
#' which defines a similarity.
#'
#' @aliases sNNclust snnclust
#' @family clustering functions
#'
#' @param x a data matrix/data.frame (Euclidean distance is used), a
#' precomputed [dist] object or a kNN object created with [kNN()].
#' @param k Neighborhood size for nearest neighbor sparsification to create the
#' shared NN graph.
#' @param eps Two objects are only reachable from each other if they share at
#' least `eps` nearest neighbors. Note: this is different from the `eps` in DBSCAN!
#' @param minPts minimum number of points that share at least `eps`
#' nearest neighbors for a point to be considered a core points.
#' @param borderPoints should border points be assigned to clusters like in
#' [DBSCAN]?
#' @param ...  additional arguments are passed on to the k nearest neighbor
#' search algorithm. See [kNN()] for details on how to control the
#' search strategy.
#'
#' @return A object of class `general_clustering` with the following
#' components:
#' \item{cluster }{A integer vector with cluster assignments. Zero
#' indicates noise points.}
#' \item{type }{ name of used clustering algorithm.}
#' \item{param }{ list of used clustering parameters. }
