\title{DS3: Spatial data with arbitrary shapes}
\format{
A data.frame with 8000 observations on the following 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{X}{a numeric vector}
\item{Y}{a numeric vector}
}
}
\source{
Obtained from \url{https://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/}
}
\description{
Contains 8000 2-d points, with 6 "natural" looking shapes, all of which have
an sinusoid-like shape that intersects with each cluster.
The data set was originally used as a benchmark data set for the Chameleon clustering
algorithm (Karypis, Han and Kumar, 1999) to
illustrate the a data set containing arbitrarily shaped
spatial data surrounded by both noise and artifacts.
